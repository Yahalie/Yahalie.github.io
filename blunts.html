<h1>The Death of a Nation | S T I L L B I R T H</h1> 
    <p><b>Introduction</b><br> 
<p style="text-indent: 50px">Mixed emotions fill the room. You are about to welcome a new life into the world. The final push has ended and there is this slight sigh of relief. Whoa, it’s finished, I made it through. The mixed emotions begin to creep out of the room, and the loud and distorted sound of silence begins to flush the room. It’s uncomfortable to everyone in the room. The new life is over before it ever began. Stillbirth. 
</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">This is the reality for many of our people as, so many of our BLK Gems are dying in the womb. We are the face of stillbirth and leading the way in the national averages. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), they claim it is occurring to us so often because we are BLK, but this eurocentric claim fails to know our inner workings. Thus, smoking blunts makes you an active participant to the steadily growing stillbirth average of BLKs; and subsequently a firm supporter of full-term abortions.</p>

    <p><b>Problem</b><br>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">Most blunt smokers unconsciously support abortions, so don’t be too hard on yourself, but please read carefully so, both you and your unborn child don’t have to be another statistic. Besides the untimely cause of stillbirth, smoking blunts has also led to birth defects, infertility, and sterilization. The Surgeon General Warning alone tells you that the blunt “May Complicate Pregnancy”, if you were unaware. So that moment when you are in the birth room wondering:  What went wrong? Take all the blunts smoked into consideration. Yeah, this can make things complicated. Moreover, we are not here dabble in the statistical numbers or examine the scientific construct of the relation of blunts to the human anatomy; or to impose our beliefs onto you but, we simply here to swiftly inform. As, the historical book of wisdom states that: “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy [Most High], I will also forget thy children (Hosea 4:6 | KJV).” In other words, now that you are knowledgeable on the dangers of smoking blunts, you can spare both you and your children.

    <p><b>Solution</b><br>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">Here are some alternatives to blunts: <br>
• | #1 Coconut Chalice or Chawla.<br>
• | #2 Rolling Papers. <br>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">o  Nat·U·Roll® – Organic Hemp <br>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">o  RAW® – Organic Hemp <br>
<br> Now it's your turn:  Do your due diligence & conduct some research. Bless.</p>
