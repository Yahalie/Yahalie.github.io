<p style="text-indent: 50px">The definition of BLK Privilege is innately defined all around Us, to where We all take it for granted. The resilience of BLK has been mentioned a countless amount of times, around the world and through the century’s. The universe is made up of almost 90% dark (or BLK) matter. This simple fact is one of the many facts We can mention to define and further illustrate BLK Privilege. Hence, We will spare you of a 1000-page novel and simply present three illustrations of BLK Privilege, through the examination of these three simple-complex questions:  1. What is it to be BLK from the aboriginal point of view? 2. What is the true meaning of Privilege? 3. Why is BLK and Privilege synonymous with each other? </p>
    <p><b>A N S W E R S</b><br>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">Question 1:  What is it to be BLK from the aboriginal point of view? Well in antiquity We often associated the color BLK with strength and of great gain of power. To the ancient people of the land of Kmt (Egypt) it represented BLK which was a color for fertility and the rich BLK soil flooded by the Nile. It was the color of Anubis, a principal that represented transformation and offered protection against evil to the dead. We still have the highest of adoration for it but we just have a tendency to take it for granted. For example, the color of elegance is BLK:  Marriage has the head wearing BLK as a symbol of power; we still wear black to funerals to offer protection to our transferring ancestors while, we drive our BLK limo to show style. In accounting, the term BLK is coined as a description of a positive balance on a company's financial statements. A company “in the BLK” means profitable in accounting just to show a few of the diverse privileges that the term BLK innately denotes. In essence, <u> BLK is Gold.</u></p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px">On the other hand, now that We have discussed BLK, let Us discuss Privilege. Question 2: What is the true meaning of Privilege? Speaking on the true implications of the term Privilege shows You some deeper hidden truths. The word has of lately been given to people who buy positions or sell their self-short for lack of knowledge. When You look at the true meaning of the word Privilege You will see that it means <u><b>a special right</b></u>, <u><b>advantage</b></u>, or <u><b>immunity granted to a group of people</b></u>. The word Privilege denotes that You innately have gifts that gives You certain advantages that other groups may not have, in BLK people it may be <u><b>Our Melanin</b></u> which is as adaptive as <u><b>the spawn suit</b></u> which means Your skin has its own mind. In modern day, We still demonstrate Privileges that We take for granted after going through slavery, mistreatment, back biting, losing basically all our leaders We still stand which is another Privilege or advantage, and a test to our resilience and overall power.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 50px">Finally, Question 3: Why is BLK and Privilege synonymous with each other? We have studied both words in-depth from the “so-called” origin (the system’s origin) to about 30 different descriptions to properly define these two terms, but what stood out the most was how similar the two were. The etymology of a word basically tells You what the creator of the word was thinking, so when You check the <u><b>etymology of Privileg</b></u>e it comes from a combination of two Latin words, the first being privus which <u><b>comes from the word private</b></u>, and lex, leg(e) which means <u><b>law</b></u>. The <u><b>dress conduct for law is BLK</b></u> because of its implications of being a secret (or private) and it also symbolizes power. The word Privilege denotes that you have some type of <u><b>given power or You have innate gifts which renders You to be “Greater” than others</b></u>. Thus, BLK and Privilege are very controversial not because of their true meaning but because of the dangerous misuse of the words. So, with this illustration it’s without a doubt when You speak of BLK, You speak of Privilege.</p>
