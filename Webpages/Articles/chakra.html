 <b><h1> INTRODUCTION </h1></b>
<p style="text-indent: 50px"> Chakras are the seven points within one’s self where your soul can travel and in perfect alignment can grant an individual divine power. The three in the lower body deal with one’s primitive nature. While, the four in the upper body engage with one’s spiritual nature. When aligned, one’s primitive and spiritual nature conjoin and peace with self is obtained. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px"> Moreover, the 1st point is the root chakra which is identified by the color red, the 2nd point is the sacral chakra which is identified by the color orange, the 3rd point is the solar plex chakra which is identified by the color yellow, the 4th point is the heart chakra which is identified by the color green, the 5th point is the throat chakra which is identified by the color blue, the 6th point is the third eye chakra which is identified by the color indigo, and the 7th point is the crown chakra which is identified by the color purple. Further, the Chakra concept represents who we were, are, and can be. It is a metaphysical explanation on the general inner workings of the Huemind. As the different levels of the chakras offer explanations and solutions to individuals operating at the lowest or highest frequencies. </p>

	<b><h1> P R O B L E M </h1></b>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">Furthermore, there are many who find the information within the chakra explanations to be a phenomenon, when this concept and practice is as old or even older than time itself. This is the first problem, we have forgotten quality practices; while, also forgetting the importance of having peace with self. Now let’s further analyze this wise teaching:  The root chakra symbolizes and embodies several things. In the huebody it is represented by the reproductive glands. Its viewed as the ground level chakra and personifies people who find themselves physically mindful, well-balanced, and relaxed in situations. The chakra is imbalanced when you are displaying levels of distrust, paranoia, and instability (under-active); or are worldly and display high levels of selfishness (over-active). The sacral chakra is represented by several organs located in the lower stomach. It embodies individuals who find themselves as the free-spirt individual that is in control of their emotions. It is evident the chakra is imbalanced when there is a consistent detachment from others (under-active) or a consistent attachment or clinginess and extreme levels of fleshly behaviors (over-active). The third chakra is represented by organs near the navel area. It embodies those who possess respect for self and respect for others, regardless of the circumstances. This chakra is imbalanced by the tendencies to be overly submissive and hesitant (under-active) or a tendency to be arrogant and hostile (over-active). The heart represents the fourth chakra and embodies those who are welcoming and compassionate individuals that can maintain cordial relationships. An imbalance is clear when an individual is unfavorable and unsympathetic (under-active) or when they are overly caring, it will be portrayed by others as “you are being self-centered” (over-active). The throat chakra represents the organs located within the throat. These individuals find themselves being openly vocal and vociferous. The chakra is imbalanced when external communication is minute or ceased completely (under-active) or when an individual’s listening skills are bad and their talking skills are seen as “too much” (over-active). The third eye chakra is represented by organs of the head. Activation is evident when an individual is clairvoyant and frequent visits to the astrorealm. An individual with an imbalance is a follower of other’s truths and dependent on other individuals imposing their beliefs on to them (under-active) or are frequent fantasist that lives in the realm of fantasy-like thoughts (under-active). While, the crown chakra is represented by the nerves connected to the brain and spine. Individuals of this stature are free from the bias spirit and see the bigger story and its inner workings; you are connected. A sign of imbalance is when an individual loses themselves within spiritual teachings and are extremely close-minded to new teachings; it may be portrayed by the individual as being “passionate” and “emotional” to the individual looking within (underactive) or they are emotionally detached and solely dependent on logic to defend their bias nature on spiritual teachings; they may overlook bodily needs, due to their strong desire to fulfill their due diligence in locating the most logical explanation, to specific spiritual teachings (over-active). In essence, seven of the seven chakras need to at least be activated.  Whether they are over or under activated is a separate case, but the major issue is many BLK people are roaming the earth with less than two of the seven activated; which is inevitably slowing down our process to solidarity and a self-reliant society. </p>
