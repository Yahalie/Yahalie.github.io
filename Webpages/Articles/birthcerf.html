 <b><h1> INTRODUCTION </h1></b>
<p style="text-indent: 50px"> “Everyone raise your hand if you know what Secular means?” The professor asked as only one person raises their hand. “Ok. You tell me what it means. Well, I can’t tell you the ‘biblical definition’ but I can give you some examples. Hmm, enlighten us. Basically, everything in the U.S.:  Marriage, Church, and most of our lives.” The teacher offers a smile. “Elaborate. Ok, look at the news for instance the easiest rule of the Ten Commandments requested that ‘[we] shall not kill’ yet here we are in 2017 with murder being as normalized as Donald Trump’s obscene behavior. This is one of the more extreme examples but what I am trying to say is there is no moral code; there’s no spiritual basis to our lives, to the churches, or even to marriage; which I am assuming you are going to lecture about today.” The student points towards the screen while the professor sits in awe [hypothetical situation]. Moreover, what this student was trying to articulate in his definition of the term Secular is this:  A thing that has no religious or spiritual basis. Further, touching on a very great point, marriage is secular, there is no religious nor spiritual basis behind a marriage license. Thus, the term marriage is as meaningless as the sheet of paper given to you known as a marriage license; it only proves that you are as incompetent, as they say you are.</p>
<b><h1> P R O B L E M </h1></b>
<p style="text-indent: 50px"> Further, when examining the problem with the marriage license three things must be looked at:  First, the etymology of the word, marriage; the terms and conditions of the marriage license, and ‘who’s name legitimizes the union. In other words, marriage derives from the Latin root word `maritus` literally meaning “of or belonging to married people” or “husband”, it means nothing in regard to the actual purpose of man and woman unionizing. Hence, that is why you find so many people who are in the Matrix defining marriage as a ring and a piece of paper, which nonetheless is nothing. It’s like your casting a spell on yourself, by contracting with a third-party entity (or the State), to be in a relationship of nothingness: a bottomless pit; and the thing that sets it in stone is the C U R S (E) – IVE imprinted by your hand on the bottom line, agreeing to the most preposterous terms and conditions. This is the second thing to examine, are the terms and conditions which, include:  Giving the State the rights to your child(ren); confirming the status of being incompetent and unable to deal with your union’s issues on your own; and admitting yourself into a secular contract, meaning no higher power allowed. In other words, this is strictly business, they don’t care about your God(s). According to Matthew 6:24 – “No man can serue two masters: for either he will hate the one and loue the other, or else hee will holde to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serue [Most High] and Mammon (KJV 1611).” This statement further contradicts many religious individuals who claim to abide by the accordance’s of the Holy Bible. As any consummation of a marriage license is of secular contractual agreement, and further the attempt of serving two masters: The Most High and the State. In addition, with a marriage license the union is legitimized in the name of the State, which further denotes the union and foreshadows a future where the union is non-existent. </p>
	<b><h1>S O L U T I O N </h1></b>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So, now what? Here are a variety of solutions on how to apply this new-found knowledge:  </p>
<ol>
  <li> First, completely reframe from calling it marriage.</li>
<ul><li>The root word in Matrimony `matr` meaning “mother” further defines and depicts the purpose of a man and woman unionizing (to be fruitful). Hence, calling it the Sacrament of Holy Matrimony or Matrimony for short, foreshadows an everlasting union and offers a visible sign of a spiritual divine grace, not a false God (known as the State).</li></ul>
  <li> For individuals Never Married</li>
	<ul><li>Collect up to seven years’ proof of Matrimony</li>
		<li>Email-Request for <b>Matrimony Affidavit</b></li>
	<li>Unionize via Notarization of  Matrimony Affidavit</li></ul>
	
  <li> For individuals Married</li>
<ul><li>Email-Request Us for the  <b>Form for Dismissal of Secular Marriage Contract</b></li>
<li> Email-Request <b>Matrimony Affidavit</b></li>
<li> Unionize via Notarization of  Matrimony Affidavit.</li></ul>
	
	
	
  <li> For individuals Married with Child(ren)</li>
<ul><li>Email-Request <b>Form for Dismissal of Secular Marriage Contract [For Child(ren)]</b></li>
<li>Email-Request <b>Matrimony Affidavit</b></li>
<li>Unionize via Notarization of  Matrimony Affidavit</li></ul></ol>
